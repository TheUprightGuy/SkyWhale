    - Yeah, I noticed you looking at those
    - Beauties aren't they?
    - They're my famous gliders!
    - Although these ones aren't quite finished yet..

    - Yep, broke my last one on another island not too far from here
    - It was a paradise for gliding
    - Long as you don't crash like I did..
    - Hey, tell you what...
    - I'm still pretty exhausted after my crash,
    - So if you were able to get the final material I need to finish off these gliders
    - I'd be happy to give one of them to you in exchange.
    - Once it's finished of course

    dialogue:
    - Perfect, I noticed the last bit of metal I need is all over the place on this
      island
    - However, most of the pieces aren't pure enough to work for these gliders
    - Think I saw an sufficiently pure piece behind the puzzle looking contraption
      when I flew over
    - If you can get it for me and bring it back, I'll give you a fully functional
      glider in return!
