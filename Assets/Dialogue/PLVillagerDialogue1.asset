    - Yes! There's nothing like it! See if you can track down the pilot if you want
      to try.
    - He's usually at the highest point on the island. Good luck tracking him down!
    - I'm actually on my way up to convince him to lend me another glider
    - Although I'm just having a short break right now
    - ... and trying to figure out how it's possible to climb up the rest of the
      way
    - If you get a glider from the pilot at the top of the island,
    - Then I'll be happy to show you some cool gliding spots!
