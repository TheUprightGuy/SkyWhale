    - It's pretty impressive that you managed to find this
    - That's the only bit of metal on this island that's pure enough for me to be
      able to finish my gliders
    - Let's make a deal..
    - If you give me this material, then I'll give you one of these gliders and the
      location of a sweet island which is perfect for gliding
