    - Okay, but my dad asked me to get parts for his glider. He gave me directions,
      but I can't seem to find them.sorry. This island began to get torn apart by
      this... storm, and I have no idea where my husband and son are.
    - Then the storm came and the stairs up to the top collapsed. His glider is the
      only way back.
